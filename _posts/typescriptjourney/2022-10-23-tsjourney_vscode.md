## Goal

Ability to test Typescript app using Jest using the UI

[Source Code](https://github.com/two4suited/TypescriptJourney/tree/vscode)

## Setup

Install the Jest Visual Studio Extension, you can also add the extension to the devcontainer.json, this will make sure the extension is there everytime you start the your dev container

This will add an icon for testing to your Activity Bar
